    <p> 
         Caerus is a Greek god. While not well known, his persona impacts our every day life. Every opportunity we are gifted is at the hand of Caerus.
      Don't mistake Caerus for luck, as luck and opportunity are not the same. </p> 
    <p> Whenever an opportunity comes along you must be quick to grab Caerus' single ponytail that hangs on his forehead. Caerus is quick, and if you fail to grab his ponytail as he speeds by... he may just come back to punish you for missing the opportunity granted. </p>
    <p> I enjoy looking at life through Caerus' perspective. It's never too late to seize an opportunity! That's why I'm learning to code. :)
